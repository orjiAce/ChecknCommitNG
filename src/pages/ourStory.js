                            <p>


                                With almost a decade of experience in logistics and supply chain management, I am now
                                embarking on this next exciting, natural progression; a new product and service review
                                platform.

                            </p>
                        </div>


                        <h4>
                            So, how did I get to this point?
                        </h4>

                            <p>
                                After my previous career in logistics, I wanted a new challenge. I wanted to take on
                                something that allowed me to spread my wings and also help others on the way.
                            </p>
                        <p>
                            I decided to follow my heart and get into something that would help consumers like myself
                            and also be beneficial to those businesses that really go the extra mile to help out
                            consumers.
                        </p>  <p>
                                Over the years, I've had a few disasters with products and services that haven't come
                                anywhere near to meeting the expectations they promised. Everything from bad hair
                                extensions to a complete no-show of my chosen wedding dress!
                            </p><p>
                            It wasn't until I spoke up about my nightmare experiences that I learned of similar
                            disappointments from many of my friends, family and colleagues.
                        </p>
                            <p> I suppose, I've always been willing to use my voice and speak out when I feel something
                                needs saying - good or bad. Many others, however, either don't want to bother speaking
                                their mind; or simply feel that they can't.
                            </p><p>
                            Now, I decided it was time to empower these people with my voice. That's how the concept of
                            ChecknCommit came about.
                        </p><p>
                            So, I took everything I'd learned from the logistics and supply chain business; combined it
                            with my experiences as a consumer and launched our community product review platform.


                        </p>

                        <h4>
                            What matters to me?
                        </h4>

                        <p>
                            Trust and honesty; and not just about being honest in itself; but about being open so people know that you are being honest. Also, saying and doing the right things.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I suppose these have always been my core personal values and they are something that I put into my business too.

                        </p><p>
                            Every day since starting this labour of love has been a privilege and a pleasure for me; serving so many great people and working with some great businesses.

                        </p>


                        <h4>
                            Why ChecknCommit?
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Because that's what you're doing on our platform. You are going there to check on a product, service or business before you actually commit to parting with your cash.
</p>
                        <p>    Hopefully I can share with you some of the benefits that so many consumers and businesses are enjoying every single day in our community.
                    </p>
                          <p> Weâ€™re based in the United Kingdom and Nigeria, but our community stretches worldwide; so, hope to see you on there soon.
                        </p>
                           <p> Best wishes,</p>
